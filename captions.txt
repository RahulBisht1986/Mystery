We were already each other’s people.
Loving you felt less like trying and more like breathing.
In your arms, the world felt quieter.
We knew each other in ways words never could.
Some days were simple, and I cherished them.
Other days were heavy, but we carried them together.
You felt like safety I never knew I needed.
Even our silence held so much love.
We weren’t perfect — we were real.
We learned how to love through difficult conversations.
I began realizing how deeply you already mattered to me.
Even our fights proved we cared too much to walk away.
I started noticing how much I depended on your presence.
You weren’t just my partner — you were my anchor.
Your love made me feel less alone in the world.
We showed up for each other, even on hard days.
I admired the way your heart loved so deeply.
We didn’t need grand love — just our quiet one.
Loving you began to feel like my natural state.
Even our routines together felt sacred.
We weathered storms without letting go.
I realized how rare and precious you are.
Our love felt calm, but deeply powerful.
You slowly became my favorite place to be.
I saw how beautifully our souls fit.
Our love wasn’t loud — it was steady and true.
We grew side by side, not apart.
I felt grateful for you in ways I couldn’t express.
You brought peace into my chaos.
I began seeing a future that only made sense with you.
Loving you became my greatest joy.
We weren’t just a couple — we were a team.
Every version of us felt worth fighting for.
Whenever I looked at you, the future felt clear.
And even now, in this very moment, I choose you.
